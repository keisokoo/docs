## Data Collection

## Permissions Used

### Host Permissions
This extension needs host permissions to enable the Picture-in-Picture functionality on any website. The extension detects and interacts with video elements across different domains to provide a consistent user experience, allowing users to benefit from the PIP feature regardless of which website they are visiting.

### Scripting
The extension uses the scripting permission to execute necessary JavaScript code in the active tab when the Picture-in-Picture functionality is activated. This is essential for detecting video elements and enabling PIP mode, especially in cases where the content script hasn't been automatically injected or needs to be executed after the page has loaded.

### Tabs
The extension requires the tabs permission to interact with and manage browser tabs for the Picture-in-Picture functionality. This permission allows the extension to access the current active tab information when triggered via shortcuts or icon clicks, identify the specific tab where a video is playing, and send necessary commands to enable PIP mode. It's also used to open the extension's options page when users want to customize their settings.

### Storage
The extension uses the storage permission to save and retrieve user preferences across browser sessions. This allows the extension to remember settings such as whether to automatically play videos when enabling PIP mode and whether to display a video selection list when multiple videos are detected on a page. Without this permission, user preferences would be lost each time the browser is closed.

## Cookies
This extension does not access or modify any cookies.
